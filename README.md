# TOP_Library_Project

This is my fifth project from The Odin Project curriculum, a book library web application that allows users to search for books using an API and store them in local storage. The goal of the project was to create a functional library that users can use to keep track of books they have read or want to read.

To achieve this, I had to use an API to fetch data on books, and then store the selected books in local storage Users can add books to their readlist.

with a search bar for finding books and a display area for showing book details.

Overall, this project helped me to further develop my skills in API calls and local storage management.
